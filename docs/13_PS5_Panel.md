* Due date: July 9th (Tue) 11pm.
* This is the last problem set!

## Rules

- If you are enrolled in Japanese class (i.e., Wednesday 2nd), you can use both Japanese and English to write your answer. 
- Submit your solution through `CourseN@vi`.
- **Important:** Submission format
  - If you use Rmarkdown, please compile your Rmarkdown file into either "html" or "PDF" file and submit **both** the compiled file and a Rmarkdown file. 
  - If you do not use Rmarkdown, please submit the document file that contains your answer and R script file (.R file) **separately**, that is, you submit **two files**.


## Question 1: Hansford and Gomez (2010, APSR)

- This problem set is based on Thomas Hansford and Brad Gomez "Estimating the Electoral Effects of Voter Turnout" The American Political Science Review Vol. 104, No. 2 (May 2010), pp. 268-288
    - Link: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/estimating-the-electoral-effects-of-voter-turnout/8A880C28E79BE770A5CA1A9BB6CF933C
- Use the same dataset I introduced in the chapter for instrumental variable estimation.

## Questions

1. What is the research question of this paper? Provide a summary in one paragraph. 
2. What is the difficulty of the analysis?  Provide a summary in one paragraph.
3. What is the research design, i.e., how do authors overcome the issue? Provide a summary in one paragraph.
4. Replicate the first three columns of Table A1 (1st stage regression in Table 1) to the best of your ability. 
5. Replicate Table 1 to the best of your ability.
7. Briefly discuss the results from Table 1 in light of the first three hypotheses (Partisan Effect Hypothesis, Two-Effects Hypothesis, and Anti-Imcumbent Hypothesis). 

**Note** 

1. Do not too much worry about the standard errors in the replication exercise. Focus on the replication of the point estimates. 
2. In Table A1, you do not have to replicate "F test (all covariates)" and "R2".  
3. In Table 1, you do not have to replicate the last five rows (i.e., the row "F test, all covariates" and below. )
4. Ignore a star `*`. Though this used to be convention, some journals recently started to require authors NOT to put any *stars* in regression tables. For a more discussion on this matter, see the followings:
